    <h5>Sauteed Brussel Sprouts</h5>

    <p> 
        Brussels sprouts are a delicious and healthy addition to any weeknight meal! They are rich in Vitamin A and C and contain antioxidants which can help improve the texture of your skin and add years to your life.
        When I was a little girl my father would always come home with a giantic sack of brussel sprouts. 
        On Christmas morning, I never looked foward to toys, dolls or money. Instead I looked foward to the 5 lbs sack of brussel sprouts that my father would gift me and my siblings. Though we weren't flashy or fancy, we could always count on brussel sprouts pie in our Christmass dinners and 
        for it to be on our school lunches. YUM!

        My only regret in life is that I never had enough brussel sprouts n my yearluy harvests. 
        I am convinced that if only I had picked i had better fertilized my soil and had bigger brussel sprouts my father would have stopped drinking. 
        So I often reminisce on my childhood when I sauteed Brussel sprouts for my husband and kids. 
        It is bittersweet for me but it is quite a dashing side-dish. You must simply get this recipe!!
